            <P>I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                Vue
                JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</P>

            <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                showed
                it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
